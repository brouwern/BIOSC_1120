### Bibliography: Recommended/Supplemental Readings

This bibliography is a compiliation of some papers that extend ideas covered in this course and will be updated regularly.

#### Case studies 

Code for understanding, reproducing and/or extending the analyses of these case studies will be used in teh course or is available for self-study.

#### Nature Methods Tutorials 

Nature Methods produces a number of short, useful tutorials.  (Though inorder to be short some rely on compact equations more than I like.)

#### Reproducibility

A major emerging issue in science is how to assure the quality of our lab/field data and the integrity of our anlayses.  Below are some examples from a rapidly growing literature on this topic.

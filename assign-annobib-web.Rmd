title: "Read Reinforcement Assignment (RRA): Annotated Bibliography Entry for Online Resource"
---

## Assignment Introduction

Statistics is a dynamic and complicated topic, with new techniques constantly being developed and almost ubiquitous debate on the nuances of different procedures.  Learning about statistics is much easier when it draws on examples that are personally interesting.  Like most textbooks, *Intutitive Biostatistics* points readers to techniques that are generally considered most useful and for which there is consensus that they work, using a few focal example to demonstrate them.  Usually these examples are medically related.

The goal of this assignment is to expand upon the book's content by identifying and briefly summarizing web-based content that discuss statistical ideas from a different perspective.  The output of this assignment will be an **annotated bibilography entry** which summarizes an online resource so that others can determine if they will find it useful (or if it might be over their head and they shouldn't bother with it).

**Frequently in my reading guide I will indicate if a topic is debated, if there are other methods available, etc, and may even provide links to blogs or quotes from podcasts.  This is low-hanging fruit for completing the assignment - feel free to follow up on things I cite or quote.**

## Assignment objectives

### Learning goals

After completing this assignment students should have a firm understanding of the assigned chapter in *Intutitive Biostatistics*  and be able to identify, evaluate, and summarize related content on the internet.  Students should also gain an appreciation for the types of statistical resources and commentary available on the internet.

<br>

### Learning outcomes

Students will be able to 

* identify the most important ideas and topics in their textbook and briefly summarize a main idea or topic from the textbook
* identify other resources related to the same topic and summarize them
* describe how the book chapter and an external resources are related, similar, and different.

<br>


## Suitable online resources

For a topic or method in a given chapter this could include resources such as

* Online articles by journalists or commentators (eg from slate.com)
* Blog posts by scientists (eg from rapidecology.com, dynamicecology.com, [Roger Peng](https://simplystatistics.org/), [Dan Quintana](https://medium.com/@dsquintana) etc)
* Podcasts by journalists or scientists (eg Rationally Speaking, Stats & Stories)
* Video tutorials or lectures by qualified people (eg Kahn Academy)
* Web apps that use animation or simulation
* Or something else cool online!

See the course website for lists of recommended bloggers, podcasts and websites.

Because the barrier of publication for online material is much lower than for peer-reviewed material, please email me with a proposed resource before completing the full assignment. 

<br>

## Suitable resources

The resources selected to complete the assignment should do at least *one* of the following:

* Shows how use R, Excel, Googlesheets, JASP, or Jamovi to solve a problem similar to what is presented in the assigned reading from Intuitive Biostatistics.
* Provides a conceptual or computational tutorial of the method oriented towards a different field than medicine (eg ecology, cell biology psychology)
* Further explains, justifies, or discusses a method, including its assumptions, history, how it gets misused (eg, the history of P-values, why we should use Welch's t-test)
* Presents an alternative to or extension of the method (eg, such as Bayesian hypothesis test)
* Critiques the method Motulsky promotes (eg why Bonferonni corrections are silly)
* Otherwise adds new context or additional nuance to a topic (eg the roll of p-values in the replication crisis in Psychology)

<br>

The resource should **not** be

* A wikipedia entry
* Another online encyclopedia 
* Academic journal article.  Articles in journals should be used to complete the journal article version of this assignment.  (Blogs appearing on journal websites, though, are ok).

Again, please contact me before completing the assignment so I can approve your chosen resource.

## Assignment Tasks

To complete this assignment, carry out the following steps:

* [___] Read the assigned chapter in Intuitive Biostatistics
* [___] Identify a particular topic or method in  the assigned chapter (eg, multiple comparisons or 2-sample t-tests)
* [___] Find a web-based resource that you find interesting and readable related to the topic.
* [___] Write out the full reference information for the resource, including title, author (if known), and URL
* [___] Write a 150-200 word annotated bibliography entry which:
  + [___] Briefly summarizes the method or topic as presented by Motulsky in the chapter
  + [___] Summarizes the topic as presented by resource you found
  + [___] Points out any differences between them, or how the reference you selected is an extension.
  + [___] Indicates who might find this resource most useful, eg "Someone struggling with R" or "Cell biologists confused by P-values."
  + [___] Indicate if this resource would be useful for future students in this class or would be more appropriate for more advanced students.
  
<br>
  
The assignment can be submitted in 2 parts. 

* First, a "rough draft" comprising the relevant citation information for your selected paper and the summary of Motulsky's (or another author's) presentation of the topic is due the week the reading was assigned.  This can be hand written.
* Second, a final draft is due the following week at the beginning of class.  Please submit the completed assignment and a print out of your selected paper in hard copy and via email by the beginning of class.

<br>

## Characteristics of the selected resource

There are no restrictions on the resource you can use for your annotated bibliography entry.  However, in general the goal is to provide additional, **accesible** resources which expands upon the content of the chapter.  The resource should ideally be by a named, professional source or at least a graduate student.  In some cases I may allow another kind of resource.

<br>

## How to find a resource

Googling the topic you are working on will likely return something interesting.  For example, I searched for "p-value podcast" and found several interesting looking results

* "Misunderstanding p-values by Everything Hertz Podcast"
* "Learn Statistics | Audio - What is a P-Value?"
* "P-value: the test that makes or breaks scientific research - Stat"
* "The P-Value Civil War - Partially Derivative."

Similarly, if you Google "p-value controversy debate" the first entry is "What a nerdy debate about p-values shows about science â€” and how to fix it" from Vox.com, which I know is a good article (and whose author was featured on a podcast, though I can't remember which one...).  A little below that is "It's Time To Stop Misusing P-Values" from fivethirtyeight.com  (The second entry Google returns is actually from an academic journal, which you could use for completing the sibling assignment to this one).

I maintain lists of interesting web-based resources on the course website.  If you look through these list you will probably find a good place to start.
